# what-does-tools-trace-do

A very basic tutorial for a rather simple library: [tools.trace](https://github.com/clojure/tools.trace)

The easiest way to get up and running is to install [leiningen][http://leiningen.org/] to get your REPL and running and [nrepl.el](https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el) to connect to it from emacs where you can then navigate to [src/what_does_tools_trace_do/core.el](https://github.com/timvisher/what-does-tools-trace-do/blob/master/src/what_does_tools_trace_do/core.clj) and then `C-M-f C-x C-e` to your hearts content.

If you have other getting started tips, feel free to send me a pull request. :)
